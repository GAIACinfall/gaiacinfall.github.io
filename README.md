## Expectation for myself in the course
<details>
  <summary> Details </summary>
  1. Coding skills <br>
     - Command of basic coding skills based on linux and python. <br>  
     - Be able to realize some algorithm. \* *e.g. Smith-waterman*  <br>
  2. Data processing  <br>
     - Be able to use tools learnt from class for data processing im my own reaserch.  <br>
     - Customizing some toolboxs for my own usage. \* *just make some small changes*  <br>
  3. Bioinfomatics perspective  <br>
     - Learn how to think from a big-data driven aspect when facing biological problems.  <br>

## 1st class-2025/2/21: introduction to bioinfo
<details>
  <summary> Details </summary>
  - All about course: what am i supposed to do <br>
      ***Grading***: attendance, homeworks and presentation <br>
      Presentation: share the coding experience (*time to be confirmed*) <br>
  - Big data driven researches <br>
    - Three dimension of gene: persons/cells/omics <br>
    - ***Probabilistic Model vs. Computational Algorithm?***   <br>
    Model: model is more like a **mathematical** stuff, it explains how could you reach B from A by using some formula to depict this process. *It tells us what we can achieve.*  <br>
    Algorithm: algorithm is about how to **realize** the things raised by a model manipulating the computer, doing some matrix transformation etc. <br>
    - Three edging technices in biology: ***Robot, Nanotech and Genetics*** <br>
    - Big-driven perspective: Thinking about what could **be revealed from the data** and the biological questions could come from data, not only your brain. <br>
