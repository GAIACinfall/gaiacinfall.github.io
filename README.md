Here includes notes on bioinfo class, to-do list during this process, and self-learing notes  
AND let's goooo

## Expectation for myself in the course
  
  1. Coding skills  
     - Command of basic coding skills based on **linux and python.**  
     - Be able to realize some algorithm. \* *e.g. Smith-waterman*
    
  2. Data processing   
     - Be able to use tools learnt from class for data processing im my own reaserch.   
     - Customizing some toolboxs for my own usage. \* *just make some small changes*
       
  3. Bioinfomatics perspective   
     - Learn how to think from a ***big-data driven aspect*** when facing biological problems.

## 1st class-2025/2/21: introduction to bioinfo 
- [x] class note
- [x] homework 1.1
- [x] homework 1.2
- [x] review and preview

  
  - All about course: what am I supposed to do  
    **Grading**: attendance, homeworks, and presentation  
    Presentation: share the coding experience (*time to be confirmed*)  


  - Three dimensions of gene: persons/cells/omics  
  - **Probabilistic Model vs. Computational Algorithm?**  
      - Model: A model is more like a **mathematical** construct. It explains how you could reach B from A by using some formula to depict this process. *It tells us what we can achieve.*  
      - Algorithm: An algorithm is about how to **realize** the things raised by a model by manipulating the computer, doing some matrix transformation, etc.  
  - Three cutting-edge techniques in biology: **Robot, Nanotech, and Genetics**  
  - Big-data-driven perspective: Think about what could **be revealed from the data** and the biological questions that could come from data, not only from your brain.

## 3rd class-blast

   - Score matrix
     - what about the difference between assemtry/un matrix when do the scoring?
   - Needlman-Wunsch: **dynamic programming**
     - recursive algorythm use dynamic programming
