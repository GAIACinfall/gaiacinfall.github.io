Here includes notes on bioinfo class, to-do list during this process, and self-learing notes  
AND let's goooo  

## Expectation for myself in the course
1. Coding skills <br>
   - Command of basic coding skills based on linux and python.
   - Be able to realize some algorithm. \* *e.g. Smith-waterman*
2. Data processing
   - Be able to use tools learnt from class for data processing im my own reaserch.
   - Customizing some toolboxs for my own usage. \* *just make some small changes*
3. Bioinfomatics perspective
   - Learn how to think from a big-data driven aspect when facing biological problems.

## 1st class: 2025/2/21: introduction to bioinfo
- All about course: what am i supposed to do <br>
    ***Grading***: attendance, homeworks and presentation <br>
    Presentation: share the coding experience (*time to be confirmed*)
- Big data driven researches <br>
  - Three dimension of gene: persons/cells/omics
  - ***Probabilistic Model vs. Computational Algorithm?***  
  Model: model is more like a **mathematical** stuff, it explains how could you reach B from A by using some formula to depict this process. *It tells us what we can achieve.*  
  Algorithm: algorithm is about how to **realize** the things raised by a model manipulating the computer, doing some matrix transformation etc.
  - Three edging technices in biology: ***Robot, Nanotech and Genetics***
  - Big-driven perspective: Thinking about what could **be revealed from the data** and the biological questions could come from data, not only your brain.
